We're collecting the new SERP features submitted by different people in this repo. This one is also collected over Airtable.

# Todo
- We will connect Airtable into Github to make it dynamic.
- Creating a guidance for the users without ability of using Git to create issues to submit them.
- Modernizing the website: serpfeature.com for better experience to add new SERP feature findings.
- Creating a Chrome extension where people can submit the SERP features like posting bug in UserSnap. (make it easy to take screenshot)
